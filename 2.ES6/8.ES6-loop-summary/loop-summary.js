/* 
1. forEach, array, for of: applicable for array
2. for in: applicable for object
*/

/* 
1. forEach: when we want to loop on array and display data in the
UI(User Interface), we will apply forEach.

2. map: When we want to do some calculation on the value of the array
and return the updated value inside of an array, we will apply map.
Ex- [2, 3, 4, 5] if we want to double the value of this array([4, 6, 8, 10]),
we will use map.

3. for of: We will use it on the array like object
Ex: [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]

4. for in: We will use it to get the keys(withou any array) of the object
