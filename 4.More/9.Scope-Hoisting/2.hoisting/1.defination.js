/* 
hoisting: In JS before execution, there is a creational phase where it finds out all the functions
and var variables and stores them on the top. At that time, it stores the functions according to
their reference, and  variables(var) as undefined. As a result before coming the creating position 
of functions and variables(var), we can use them. That is hoisting.
