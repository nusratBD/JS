/* What is execution Context */
/* 
How do we write code?
When we write code, we usually break codes into severl parts such as function, 
module, package, etc. We do it to reduce the complexity of code.

Similary interpreter also breaks the codes into different small pieces to reduce
the complexity. All these small pieces are called execution context.
