/* 
At the beginning, JS was an interpreted language. There was no compiling process
in JS.
*/

/* 
Interpretation Vs Compilation:
Interpretation and Compilation both transform our code into machine code.
Although task is same for both, processes are different.

Human Code Example:
function test(){
    console.log('Hello);
}

Machine Code Example:
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001


There are three way to transform human code into machine code:
1. Interpretation
2. Compilation
3. Mixture of Both
